# AO: Agent Orchestration

## A Coordination Layer for Human-Level Robot Intelligence (HLRI)

Agent Orchestration (AO) is a unified coordination layer designed to integrate
and orchestrate multiple adaptive AI agents within a Human-Level Robot
Intelligence (HLRI) system.

In HLRI environments, intelligent behavior emerges from the collaboration of
specialized agents that adapt to space, users, and objects in real time.
AO serves as the central orchestration component that enables these agents to
operate as a single, coherent system rather than as isolated modules.

By managing execution flow and scheduling across agents, AO allows
the system to respond consistently to dynamic environments and user demands.
